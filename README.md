Hello I'm NukolLodda
I am a modder for Minecraft who made Tekora and Modussy
I am also currently studying computer science and as of now, I can write
programs in both python and java, however, I might know more and you'll
never know...

Age: Minor (in High School) <br>
Pronouns: He/him <br>

**Projects I Have**

I am the head developer of the Minecraft mod series, <a href=https://github.com/NukolLodda/Tekora>Tekora</a> and
I'm also currently working on another Minecraft mod, <a href=https://github.com/NukolLodda/Modussy>Modussy</a> as a solo project.

I have a couple of resources I've hand crafted myself that allows me to basically generate files since the mods
I make often needs hundreds of json files that are basically replicas with a couple values changed

They can all be found <a href=https://github.com/NukolLodda/MinecraftModdingFacilitater>here</a>.

All my mods are under CC-BY-NC unless otherwise stated,
ie if you were to copy and distribute my mods
you must let the person know that I made it and that
you can NOT make money distributing/making copies of my mod,
minor snippets of code are ok since I understand that finding info
online on Minecraft modding can be quite difficult but the merging
and copying of my projects must abide by the license.
However this license only applies to my mods or anything else I
make in Java or maybe C++ if I ever figure that language out
and programs I made in python can be distributed and copied freely.

**About Me**

<br>

I am currently a High School Student in the United States of America who's studying and planning to
minor in computer science. I made this repository to share some of my projects but also to allow ease
of access for other members within my team to access files. But also so my jokes will be immortalized
in the form of a digital footprint.
<br>
My hobbies include:
- videogaming
- drawing (sometimes)
- making programs as a joke

<br>

**What Inspired Me To Do Modding**

<br>

Modding has been a long time dream of mine since I was in around 5th grade.

However, watching other people play mods and a mix of my creative desire is what mainly inspired me to do modding

**Future Projects**

<br>

I don't actually plan to persue a career in computer science but I do have plans for a couple of programs that doens't involve
modding Minecraft to make content off of. Though none of them are games but rather, just another series of jokes since
making joke programs are quite fun. I don't however plan to make any mods after Modussy and the Tekora mod series.

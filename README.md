Hello I'm NukolLodda
I am an aspiring modder for Minecraft who plans to make mods in the future
I am currently studying computer science and as of now I can write simple programs in python.
However, I hope not too soon in the future, I will be able to learn and understand Java

I like to write programs in python as a joke like those in my repository

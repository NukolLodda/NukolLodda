**Projects I Have**

I am the head developer of the Minecraft mod series, <a href=https://github.com/NukolLodda/Tekora>Tekora</a> and
I'm also currently working on another Minecraft mod, <a href=https://github.com/NukolLodda/Modussy>Modussy</a> as a solo project.

I have a couple of resources I've hand crafted myself that allows me to basically generate files since the mods
I make often needs hundreds of json files that are basically replicas with a couple values changed

They can all be found <a href=https://github.com/NukolLodda/MinecraftModdingFacilitater>here</a>.

**About Me**

<br>

I am currently a High School Student in the United States of America who's studying and planning to
minor in computer science. I made this repository to share some of my projects but also to allow ease
of access for other members within my team to access files. But also so my jokes will be immortalized
in the form of a digital footprint.
<br>
My hobbies include:
- videogaming
- drawing (sometimes)
- making programs as a joke

**What Inspired Me To Do Modding**

<br>

Modding has been a long time dream of mine since I was in around 5th grade.

However, watching other people play mods and a mix of my creative desire is what mainly inspired me to do modding

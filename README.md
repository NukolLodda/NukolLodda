Hello I'm NukolLodda
I am a modder for Minecraft who made Tekora and Modussy

never know...

**Projects I Have**
I am the head developer of the Minecraft mod <a href=https://github.com/NukolLodda/Tekora>Tekora</a> and
I'm also currently working on another Minecraft mod, <a href=https://github.com/NukolLodda/Modussy>Modussy</a> as a solo project.

I have a couple of resources I've hand crafted myself that allows me to basically generate files since the mods
I make often needs hundreds of json files that are basically replicas with a couple values changed

They can all be found <a href=https://github.com/NukolLodda/MinecraftModdingFacilitater>here</a>.

**What Inspired Me To Do Modding**
<br>

Modding has been a long time dream of mine since I was in around 5th grade. I remember back before I had a PC of any kind
where I would watch videos of people playing modded Minecraft, which in of itself inspired me to try the game
out myself, only to be dissapointed when finding out that Bedrock edition doesn't have support for mods and that some
"mods", you'd have to pay for. I've wanted to try to make a mod for myself since and watched tons of videos on how to do
so only to end up with no progress. In the end, I eventually got a PC and Minecraft Java Edition, I tried modded Minecraft
for the first time.
I was overjoyed since it's something I've wanted to do for a long time but I wasn't exactly satisfied in the end. It was
around this time I began taking computer science which has allowed me to gain an understanding of Java, the programming language
Minecraft "Java" Edition is based on (I know right, how shocking ðŸ˜²). In the end, it was a creative desire within me
to make mods for Minecraft.

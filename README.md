**About Me**

<br>

I made this repository to share some of my projects but also to allow ease
of access for other members within my team to access files.
But also to share my jokes that I've converted into programs.

**What Inspired Me To Do Modding**

<br>

Modding has been a long time dream of mine since I was in around 5th grade.
Ultimately, watching other people play mods and a mix of my creative desire is what mainly inspired me to do modding.

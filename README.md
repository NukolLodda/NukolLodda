Hello I'm NukolLodda
I am a modder for Minecraft who made Tekora and Modussy
I am also currently studying computer science and as of now, I can write
programs in both python and java, however, I might know more and you'll
never know...

---
I am the head developer of the Minecraft mod <a href=https://github.com/NukolLodda/Tekora>Tekora</a> and
I'm also currently working on another Minecraft mod, <a href=https://github.com/NukolLodda/Modussy>Modussy</a> as a solo project.

I have a couple of resources I've hand crafted myself that allows me to basically generate files since the mods
I make often needs hundreds of json files that are basically replicas with a couple values changed

They can all be found <a href=https://github.com/NukolLodda/MinecraftModdingFacilitater>here</a>

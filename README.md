Hello I'm NukolLodda
I am an aspiring modder for Minecraft who plans to make mods in the future
I am currently studying computer science and as of now I can write simple programs in python.
However, I hope not too soon in the future, I will be able to learn and understand Java

I like to write programs in python as a joke like those in my repository
m_rated_python_program_but_its_all_a_joke with absolute literal nonsense
however I have been practicing a little bit in Java thought non has been
uploaded to Github.

I also make occasional contents on Youtube and Tiktok(my usernames there
are also NukolLodda) and I might just showcase code there every once in
a while.
